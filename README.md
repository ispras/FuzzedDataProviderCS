# FuzzedDataProviderCS

*Made as a part of __Competence Center Community__ activities (Telegram: @sdl_community)*



FuzzedDataProvider for C#, inspired by Google's FuzzedDataProvider. Look at: 
- common description and the conception of Structure Aware Fuzzing  https://github.com/google/fuzzing/blob/master/docs/split-inputs.md#fuzzed-data-provider
- source code https://github.com/llvm-mirror/compiler-rt/blob/master/include/fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h
- example https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/dbda4024104e/examples/fuzzers/cpp/fuzzed-data-provider.cc
- abstract (mostly in Russian) [Structure_Aware_Fuzzing_and_logical_erros.pdf](Docs/Structure_Aware_Fuzzing_and_logical_erros.pdf) 

Made for using with C#-fuzzers (like https://github.com/Metalnem/sharpfuzz).

### HowTo (Test run):

Ubuntu 20.04, install .NET 6 (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu#2004-), then:

```
dotnet build
dotnet test FuzzedDataProviderCSTest
```

In case of troubles with Debuger (because of different target platforms of Library and Test), make `dotnet clean`, and then build all the projects for x64, like: 
```
dotnet build -a x64 FuzzedDataProviderCSLibrary/FuzzedDataProviderCSLibrary.csproj
dotnet build -a x64 FuzzedDataProviderCSTest/FuzzedDataProviderCSTest.csproj
```
Also try to restart restart VSCode after rebuild (developed and tested with VSCode).

### HowTo (Main commands):

1. Create FuzzedDataProviderCS class instance. You must pass to the constructor an array to be parsed (mandatory property).You can instruct the instance to exit the program (and, in case of fuzzing, move to the next iteration) when all the fuzzed data was consumed, but not all concuming calls were done (arbitrary property).

2. Start consuming the data using consuming functions (all public functions are self-documented):

- ConsumeByte()
- ConsumeChar()
- ConsumeInt16()
- ConsumeUInt16()
- ConsumeInt32()
- ConsumeUInt32()
- ConsumeInt64()
- ConsumeUInt64()
- ConsumeDouble()
- ConsumeDateTime()
- ConsumeEnum()
- ConsumeBytes()
- ConsumeRemainingBytes()
- ConsumeString()
- ConsumeRemainingAsString()

3. Most of the functions allows you to set a range or a set of possible values. For example:
- you can instruct the instance to consume an Int32 in a Range [-8; 20359];
- you can instruct the instance to consume a String where all of the symbols must belong to a Set of ['a', 'B', '8', 'Ä‚'];
- etc.

### HowTo (Example):

### Tasks:
1. Templatize it using Generics/Abstract class.
2. Test in DNF/Win.
3. Make shims and test for another encoding order (need fix for Pose library https://github.com/tonerdo/pose/issues/69).
4. Add Array/List consumers.
